# Edublogs Clone
 A simple clone of the edublogs website recreated with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I created this clone to practice restful routing and to have a good reference I can go back to if I ever want to look back at it. This project contains all seven aspects of routing and they're all implemented.
